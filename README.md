# CS4200-W24-Project1
1) How to run and compile
"Since I've used Java Eclipse for compilation and execution, I recommend opening Java Eclipse and following these steps:
a)	Click on 'File' > 'Import' > 'General' > 'Project from Folder or Archive.'
b)	A window will appear, and you should select 'Directory.'
c)	Ensure that you have extracted the contents of 'NhanThai_project1.zip' into a folder named 'NhanThai_project1.'
d)	Inside this folder, you will find a directory named 'CS4200_W24_Project1.' Navigate to this folder's directory.
e)	Select the folder and click 'Finish' to complete the import process.
f)	Once imported, locate the 'Driver.java' file and execute the program."

2) Single Test Puzzle
The screen will tell you how to choose the entry method and the heuristic function to use. Random will make a puzzle at random, but you will still be asked to enter a heuristic function. Input, on the other hand, will ask you to enter a permutation of the numbers 0 through 8 that will be the puzzle.

4) Multi-Test Puzzle
When you give the program a filename, it read its data and make a list of all the sources that were found.

5) Exit program
The program will loop endlessly so if you want to stop the program, press ‘3’ to stop it.

6) Other notes:
"The 'input' folder contains text documents that display information in the Java Eclipse console. 
The 'output' folder contains a Word file that presents images and console output. 
The 'report' folder includes a comprehensive project report and a table summarizing the results of running 100 cases for each depth, totaling 1000 cases."
